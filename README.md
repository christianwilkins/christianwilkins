I'm a software engineer and developer advocate with a passion for building awesome technology and pushing the bounds of what is possible.

My philosophy is simple: share what I know, stay curious, and create space for others to grow. I enjoy pushing myself and learning more every day!

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m a amatuer chef by passion. If you have any recipes feel free to send them over ðŸ”¥
